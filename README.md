# Smart Pot IoT Project - SEP4 VIA
## Overview
The Smart Pot IoT Project is an innovative solution for automating plant care. This project utilizes IoT technology to monitor soil moisture levels and water container status, ensuring that plants receive the optimal amount of water. The system operates in cycles, automatically checking the moisture levels and water container, and watering the plant when needed. The project also includes a firmware flasher for easy deployment to Arduino Mega2560 controllers.

THIS PROJECT IS A PART OF A BACKEND AND FRONTEND SYSTEM. THE PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK BY ITSELF.

## Features
Automatic Soil Moisture Monitoring: Continuously checks soil moisture levels to determine the watering needs of the plant.
Water Container Status Monitoring: Ensures there is sufficient water available in the container for watering the plant.
Automated Watering System: Waters the plant when the soil moisture falls below a certain threshold.
Scheduled Cycles: Operates in predefined cycles to periodically check moisture levels and water the plant.
Firmware Flasher: Simplifies the deployment of firmware to Arduino Mega2560 controllers.

## Components
Arduino Mega2560: Microcontroller used for processing data and controlling the watering system.
Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures the moisture level in the soil.
Water Level Sensor: Monitors the water level in the container.
Water Pump: Delivers water from the container to the plant.
Relay Module: Controls the water pump based on signals from the Arduino.
Firmware Flasher Tool: Software tool for uploading the firmware to the Arduino Mega2560.
